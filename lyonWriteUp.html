                    The Louisiana Tech Wrestling Club opened up the season on November 15th at Lyon College in Batesville, Arkansas. The Bulldogs faced off against host Lyon College and Central Baptist College, stepping up to face an NCAA Division III team and an NAIA team.
                </p>

                <h3>Lyon College Dual (Louisiana Tech 26 - Lyon College 23)</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In the first dual of the day, the Bulldogs faced off against Lyon College. The dual began with Louisiana Tech forfeiting the 125 and 133 pound weight classes, double forfeiting 141, and freshman Samuel Favaza collecting a forfeit at 149 to put Louisiana Tech down 12-6 going into the first contested match. 
                    Graduate student Sean Bell at 157 pounds fought hard against a tough opponent, but ultimately surrendered a technical fall, putting the Bulldogs down 17-6. At 165 pounds, Freshman Larry Davis made quick work of his opponent, securing a fall in 1:01 to bring Tech within 5 points at 17-12.
                    Sophmore, President, and Captain Micah Tompson at 174 pounds earned a hard fought decision, closing the gap to just 2 points at 17-15. At 184 pounds, Raiden Flores, another freshman, secured a quick 20 second fall to give Tech its first lead of the dual - 21-17. Senior, Vice President and Captain Raymond Favaza
                    continued the momentum with a dominant technical fall at 197 pounds over a returning national qualifier, extending Tech's lead to 26-17. At heavyweight, Noah Lucas, a sophomore, who started wrestling in only April of this year, stepped up from his usual 197 pound weight class to take on a much larger opponent.
                    Lucas wrestled tough, but ultimately fell to a fall, bringing the score to 26-23, and securing a Bulldog victory over NCAA Division III Lyon College.

                <h3>Central Baptist College Dual (Louisiana Tech 20 - Central Baptist College 24)</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Fresh off the momentum from their previous dual, the Bulldogs faced off against Central Baptist College. Just as before, the Bulldogs forfeited the 125 and 133 pound weight classes, double forfeiting 141. This time, however, Samuel Favaza at 149 pounds earned a hard fought 10-4 decision, to put Tech on the board.
                    Sean Bell at 157 pounds once again had a tough opponent, however this time, he was able to hold the match to a decision with a reversal in the last 45 seconds. Larry Davis once again produced a dominant showing to start his freshman campaign with a first period pin to make the dual score 15-9 in favor of Central Baptist.
                    Micah Tompson at 174 pounds fought hard, but ultimately fell, surrendering a decision, extending Central Baptist's lead to 18-9. Raiden Flores at 184 pounds continued his strong showing on the day with a technical fall, bringing Tech within 4 points at 18-14. Raymond Favaza at 197 pounds collected a forfeit, giving the 
                    Bulldogs a 20-18 lead going into the heavyweight match. Noah Lucas once again stepped up to take on a larger opponent at heavyweight. Noah wrestled hard, but ultimately was pinned giving Central Baptist the 24-20 victory over Louisiana Tech. A strong showing from the bulldogs against a tough NAIA team.
